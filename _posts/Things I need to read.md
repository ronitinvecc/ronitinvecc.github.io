# My first post

Hey this is my first custom post. committed on 10-07-2023. I feel pretty good about this.

Okay so here are a bunch of things that I gotta study. Really simple stuff to be honest. 

1. Markup guide [Github Markup documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
2. Guide to your 20s [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuEN1KbjjTE)
3. An [***aid***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhXJ3Ivxtg&t=141s) to treat the hopeless loser in you.
