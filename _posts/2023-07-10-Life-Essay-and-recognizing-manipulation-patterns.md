# How to detect a manipulator, how to detect manipulation and how to manipulate and be powerful.

### Detect manipulation
1. Do not outshine the master or the one that has any power/ authority over you. 
  Power/authority != leverage/dirt. Don't correct teachers in class, go to their room if you have a doubt. Connect with them on a greater/ personal level. Pretend to be friends. Dig up what you can dig. Not unnecessary stuff but necessary stuff. But never publicly outshine the master or piss of the wrong kind of people.
2. Isolation is dangerous. Isolation and putting up walls/ being in the dark unaware of what people are doing in their lives or what is happening in everyone (around and under you)'s life is very very disastrous. It's an easy hack to enter and start living life on autopilot mode.
3. Familiarity breeds contempt. Familiarity or empathy often makes the one on the receiving end of empathy believe they are on the same level as you are. Don't make it seem like you've had it harder. This isn't "difficulty" olympics. Do not sympathize/ empathize very much. Do not say "Even I have been through this", "I was in a similar situation back then". Do not start unwarranted therapy. Give backhanded solutions. Don't actually try to help someone out of their misery. Their problems != Your problems. Do not carry someone else's mental baggage. Always avoid people who are always miserable and sad and nothing goes right for them in their lives. For sad people or people going through something, just lending a listening ear makes you far more likeable than talking and providing free unasked therapy. Sometimes stfu and listen and empathize with a limit and caution.
4. Despise the free lunch. Don't take unnecessary favours from people. You start owing people a lot more than they owe you. That sucks. That also gives them leverage. "Hey janedoe, remember I <insert service>. I gotta ask you to repay that favour with <insert demand>".
5. Never accept your mistake. NEVER. Reputation must be spotless. Even if you are caught, pass it off as something trivial. Be spotless. Be perfect. Manipulate people into believing that it might have been their fault instead of yours. If it was your fault see and find if their might have been some source of error from their side. If yes then highlight then when people hold you accountable and say well you did this wrong too so I guess we are equal.
6. Delegate tasks instead of being a worker bee. Take credit for what you did. Every single bit of what you did. People have a slave tendency of god worship and obeying the boss/ shepherd. That way even if things fail it was an error by the worker bees. The queen bee sits at the throne. Never shy away from taking credit for what you did. NEVER. People will want some part of that cake. Make things clear of the percentage of effort you put in and make sure that gets written. Again, subtlety is key (NOT moderation but subtlety). And, reputation needs to be guarded with your life.
7. Make tough achievements look effortless. "oh that <tough thing> was ez pz! oh you couldn't do it? it wasn't that difficult. I mean of course it might be difficult for beginners like you. Approach me later and I'll show you how to do it one day. Not today though. I'm a little busy today. See ya!"
8. Plan ahead - not very ahead but sufficiently ahead. Consider all (most of) the possibilities. You won't fall flat on your face in that case. Be ready for incoming situations. Adapt and improvise alright but still plan much much ahead.
9. Learn how to accept defeat. Don't cope too hard. You won't always win. Learn how to accept defeat and come back stronger. Never let anybody humiliate you. Use leverage and manipulation. Threats, if necessary.
10. Learn how to humiliate someone and make them look like a clown. Not everyone has the capacity of springing back. Don't offend the wrong person and don't take humiliation too far. On the other hand, completely vanquish the self esteem of the individual in front of everyone or even privately (keep proof if private to show it to people later) completely at that point/moment. Slay your enemy completely. Don't take it too far.
11. Don't be unnecessarily "different". Think as you like, behave like others. Human beings like people who they can connect with. Being different might sound classic or elitist but not always. Learn when to blend and when not to blend. Don't always look for benefit while making friends but at the same time don't always act like a fuckin wallflower. Be one with the bros.
12. Court attention and spotlight. Be good at something and be the supreme authority at that particular thing. Make everyone know and acknowledge your skills and that one thing you are good at. Again, God worshipping is human nature. Tap into it.
13. STUDY HARD AND KNOW YOUR GOAL. All of the shit above wouldn't matter for an academically weak student or a financially weak man. Make sure you don't forget the most important part. SEX, CASH, GRADE and FAME (sidequests FIT BODY, MENTAL PEACE, CONNECTIONS). Your primal motivation is to hold absolute authority and your biggest and only mission is to be better than every-fucking-one. "Hey Kevin, was that a challenge? You and everyone around you knows I'm better than you. I have proof. So shut it." People should spend sleepless nights out of jealousy and internal torment thinking about you. People should revere you. Their self respect must dwindle at your sight. Never back down on the four priorities - SEX, CASH, GRADE and FAME.
14. It always gets better. 
You are a tortured soul and have been through some very bad and tough times. 
Tough times won't last. You will spring back. 
You are not dumb, you are unmotivated and very... very sad. In order to be big and successful you need to take little steps but those should bring happiness and joy and not contempt. 
Fall in love with what you do. 

### What you should do
* And don't let people detect your self doubt.
* Say people you are fucking happy with where you are presently at.
* Learn communication and how to convey your exact message properly.
* Tell them exactly what you feel is right and is going wrong and ask them to correct you if you are wrong about some particular thing. Be humble but not subjugated. \
* Learn skillful communication.

## LIFE IS MUCH EASIER THAN WE MAKE IT,
* Do the right thing.
* Don't care what people think of you.
* Guard your reputation and never settle for anything less than what you deserve.
* And try. Nihilism is for losers. Be excited. The planet glorifies sadness. Don't fall prey.
* Things will fall into place. Love your mind. Love your body. Love yourself. Cherish the people around you.
* It will all be fine. Your future self will thank me. Life is beautiful and worth fighting for.

### Simpler hacks that are easier to comprehend -
* Be treated with respect.
* Be dedicated and show up. Showing up is very very very important. Hobby/ skill/ past-time activity, whatever. If you commit then you fucking show up. Understand. This is a threat.
* Learn how to say NO. Not everything or everyone is worth your damn time.
* Marry your job. Love your job. And be the best at it.
* Look for opportunities and always assess your quality of work.
* Be impeccable at one or a bunch of things.
* Do not multitask. Finish one thing up quickly and then move on.
* If something takes 5/10/15 minutes in a shorter amount of time to be achieved or it is simple manual labour, do that first. Labour work is easier than analytical work. Your hands don't always think.
* Mastery comes from repetition and not perfectionism. Remember that. Do something for long enough and watch it become your muscle memory. Expand your horizons. Soon enough you will be a GOD at that particular thing.
* Don't trust your friends too much but also have plenty of people to rely and depend upon to play them as pawns in a war.
