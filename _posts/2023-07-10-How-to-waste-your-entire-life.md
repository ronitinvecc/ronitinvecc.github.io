# **How to waste your life**:-

1. Don’t think about life.
   1. Let things take their course. Depend upon uncertainties and the probabilistic nature of life and later blame it all on luck.
   2. Do not plan your life and make the really hard decisions. Easier to live life on the same path.
   3. You must think you are SO busy right? Busy doing what?? If you are busy, that means you are doing things right. Right? So what if the things you have packed them with might not be the best use of that time? So what if they waste your time, energy, and potential?
2. Ignore your relationships
   1. Relationships with any person are a lot of drama. People are difficult.
   2. Close relationships strongly impact happiness. It doesn’t mean we need to focus on relationships.
   3. They are hard work, and they might not work out. Heartbreak and abandonment are hard work. What are the odds that the relationships might actually work out? What if the relationships have a healthy impact on your life? What if they stay? What if they pay back? What if it helps you learn something about the wonderful spectrum of creatures and all the different flavors that human beings come as?
   4. It’s more important to focus on myself to improve my life. I should Ignore others because who would want to help me anyway. Right? My thoughts, opinions, and emotions are the only important thing. I am always right. Why should I help?
   5. I am always right and know everything, and I can’t be wrong, so why should I care to invest my life pursuing a relationship and try and understand a human individual that has come close to my life in some way because it might harm me. As if my self-destructive habits and patterns don’t already do that to me.
3. Condemn yourself to mediocrity
   1. I am not good enough. I am not smart enough. I am not talented enough. I am not strong enough. I am not tall enough. I am not good-looking enough.
   2. People might laugh at me and talk behind their backs. People might make fun of me, and people might talk behind my back and gossip. Failing sucks, right? I don’t want to fail. Insert [fancy thing] and [luxury] that uplifts my social status quo publicly is meant for other people and clearly not meant for me. Because I am meant to be a human shadow in the background in the sea of billions of people. I have to be as undetectable and not garner any or all attention because that is the kind of shy, introverted loser I am. I am habituated to being an undetectable human shadow in the background that is almost nonexistent to people and do not impact people’s life. Because that would mean, people would rely on and depend on me, and that is hard work, and I do not have it in me to do that.
   3. I won’t adapt to change. I am scared of uncertainty and resistant to change. “Nah, I’m good” is my life motto. Nah, I am not talking about nitpicking things. I do not have that kind of luxury. Beggars can’t be choosers. Yes, do say no to things that are going to sabotage you. But I don’t think a loser like you has an infinite amount of options, do you?
5. Things will automatically come to me.
   1. I won’t need to do what I am supposed to do regularly.
   2. I don’t need to show up at [insert place] at [insert time] to do [insert thing].
   3. Why? Cuz it’s fucking tough, and I lack the tenacity for that.
   4. Courage and discipline have never shown to accomplish anything, right?
   5. So what’s the point if things will never change for me? If I will remain the same for me. If my life is an excruciating and eternal circle of pain. Instagram is never leaving planet Earth, is it??
   6. What if God tests my limits, and I am trapped in an endless circle of character development lessons? Have you maybe thought that you didn’t try enough? Maybe all the effort you put in would sum up and show what you are truly capable of, given you worked hard?
   7. Have you maybe thought that the first time you failed, the conditions and situation weren’t in your favor? That the circumstances weren’t conducive enough for you to succeed. If you want it that bad, why don’t you try harder next time and try to figure out what went wrong and make it right because you deserve all the things and every single thing that you worked hard for? How about you know what it is you are fighting for and know what to do and do the right thing?
7. Everything happens for a reason, right? Hard work is not going to change that fact.
   1. Courage and discipline will not change anything
   2. I don’t need to follow my schedule and show up at places I am supposed to. I don’t need to show up early at work. I don’t need to attend all my classes. I don’t need to dedicate more time and hours to that one thing that I like doing and will eventually benefit my entire fucking life. I don’t need to get a good body, look better and feel better about myself. I definitely don’t need to study more, and I don’t need to get better and make myself better.
   3. I don’t need to go to the gym. Cuz looking good and feeling good about myself and my body isn’t something that I have time for and is not something made for me. Plus, people will gossip that I go to the gym and laugh behind my back.
   4. Fuck them; they are imbeciles. I am always right.  Fuck the world. I am always right.
   5. Maybe I am always right, but should I ever introspect and verify? No!
   6. See how things I did could be made better with careful and conscious introspection and verification? Things I don’t know could be known by practice and spending time on that. Maybe not in one night, maybe not in two nights?
   7. What if I start to commit to it for a period of time and hit all the marks with my most attentive state of mind and deep focus? Well, I know I will still not change. This will lead to suicide and paralysis and depression, and maybe even darker things. Even though everybody is helping you to redeem yourself. You yourself aren’t. Idk why, though. Impostor syndrome. Some deep-seated self-hate and regret or childhood trauma manifesting itself into this shape and form. Whatever it is, I won’t try to get my shit together.
   8. What if, even by accident, you checked your mistakes again? That one competitive programming solution. That one qc program in that one competition. What if you took a breath before answering a question asked in an interview and cracked onto one of the biggest companies on the face of the earth? What if you did land a crore package? Are you prepared for that fortune? Do you stay optimistic? Do you work hard? Don’t because it is difficult. All this is going to end up in the trash. And it will be the same thing over and over, all over again.
   9. Like the movies? The losers are always losers, and winners always winners. The hero wins, and the villain, no matter how strong, always loses. I know the ending of all the movies, so I stopped watching halfway through because I already knew the ending. There is no thrill in doing anything because I am never wrong, and I know everything. I have no joy. I am nihilistic because brooding cigarette-smoking nihilistic people who say shit like we as a civilization are heading towards doom and all that crap sounds super fucking cool, doesn't it?
   10. If someone fires me, dislikes me, doesn’t buy my product, or doesn’t listen to me, it’s because they are wrong and they have an agenda and have hate against me beyond anything I have produced, created, and built. It's a personal vendetta always, ad hominem always cuz whatever I make is fucking perfect. It couldn’t be about what I did or what I made or built because that is fucking perfect.
   11. People, by default, think I am a bad person or a creep. So I hate myself and am scared of making the first move cause my self-image in my mind is that of a monster. Not that of an eager, kind, and warm human being because that is what I think of myself. When I had ~~w#ed~~ that one day in LLR. I just saw a monster in the bathroom mirror. That is my picture of myself. I am a sad monster whom everybody despises. No therapy can treat you except self-love.
   12. I am not a leader. I am background noise, only alive to keep my parents happy. And adding no value or substance to this planet, however much I deceive or gaslight myself.
8. I am good enough wherever I am in life. 
   1. I am a consumer and not a creator.
   2. I am not creating something because, in that case, people will see me, and what if they laugh at me? I can’t start my website, or my business, organize things, take charge, and do it because it is simpler to talk about doing these things than doing them and achieving them or organizing things. Let’s watch Netflix instead of making something for Netflix like my own fucking IIT KGP seniors did? I can’t. I am not made up for that shit. ~~That is exactly not what got me kicked out of TFPS~~.
   3. I should put the fear of failure above everything else.
   4. After you waste your life, you might want to waste your money staying up late and eating at night canteens because why not. Papa is always there. Beg your way through life.
  
Dying a loser is worse than anything. You don't have to think anything about death, though. Just, please. Please clean your mess up. I **still** believe in you. Yeah, no sarcastic side comment. I do. Things will be better. Because as much as I hate it. I am a selfish and perfectionist guy who always and always claims what is rightfully his. You will be big. But if you don't rectify your formative years, that is today. You might not amount to much in life, which would be such a shameful waste of a gift to the world. This is not an affirmation. This is, but just a fact.
